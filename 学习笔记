1.为什么有时候QQ-plot会出现整体上漂的现象？
可能是存在一些未被发现的系统误差，例如population structure，relatedness，technical bias，or poor quality genotype.
2.Note : association is not causation!
3.EIGENSOFT:可用于做genetics principle component analysis
4.LocusZoom：放大局部SNP的信息


Secondary analysis after GWAS
1. Estimating the varience explained by sets of SNPs (GWAS significant SNPs, or deep list of SNPs)
2. Fine-mapping : what are the independent or potential causal SNPs in the locus?
3. Pleiotrophy :Does a SNP relate to multiple traits?
4. Risk prediction : Does a score of genetic markers predict disease?
5. Mendelian randomization : leveraging genetic markers to get at causality of biomarkers?
6. Pathway analysis : Are the association loci linked biologically?
  Software:
 DEPICT: a data-driven, intergrative method that uses gene sets reconstituted on the basis of large-scale expression data to prioritize genes and gene sets and also indentify tissues enriched in highly expressed gene from associated loci and prioritize tissues and individual gene 
 MEGENTA:Identify gene sets enriched in GWAS data
 GRAIL: use the published data to highlight the connections between likely relevent genes within GWAS-indentified loci
